    Builds a password out of the values passed in. Intended to be imported
    into your own projects.

    Metroid stores most of the values it cares about as booleans, with three 
    exceptions: current missile count, game age, and start location, which it
    converts to binary. Each value is then stored into a long string of bits,
    Through a fairly convoluted process, that string of bits is then turned 
    into a series of six-bit decimal numbers, and each number corresponds to
    one of the valid characters in the list below.
